# Reflections – AI Portfolio Assistant Project

## Overview
This project challenged our team to apply Agile and Kanban principles while building an **AI-powered portfolio assistant** that generates professional bios and “About Me” sections.  
We combined what we learned from **Git version control, Agile project management, and Generative AI** to create a functional web app using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (frontend)** and **Node.js (backend)**.

### 1. Muziwakhe Sitsha (Frontend Developer)
The good:
The chat interface came together nicely with smooth animations and a professional gradient design. The quick option buttons were a great addition because they guide users who might not know what to ask and make the interface feel more interactive
The challenges:
CSS was abit more challenging than expected. Getting the message bubbles perfectly aligned and the gradients just right took multiple iterations. The Js chat logic had some growing paints too, managing loading states and scroll behavior required careful debugging
Key learning:
I learnt sometimes simple solutions work best. What started as complex animation ideas ended up as clean, functional code that focuses on user experience. The mobile responsive were challenging but essential for real world use
Overall, building this front-end taught me to balance esthetics with functionality and to test early across different devices.

### 2. Celimpilo Gumede (Backend Developer)
I worked on the backend logic and API integration. This was my first time connecting an AI model API (like OpenAI or Gemini) to a JavaScript server, and I learned a lot about handling routes, responses, and deployment issues.  
Initially, I struggled with **package.json syntax errors**, but this taught me the importance of proper JSON validation and attention to detail. The debugging process helped me understand how to read error messages more effectively and trace problems to their source.  
Through this, I became more confident in using Node.js modules, managing dependencies, and testing API endpoints. I also learned how backend issues can affect the entire app flow and why consistent collaboration with frontend developers is crucial for seamless integration.

## Team Reflection
As a group, we learned that **clear communication, consistent updates, and regular testing** are key to delivering a functioning product.  
The Kanban approach helped us stay organized and accountable.  
Our main challenge was deployment and API configuration, but through collaboration, we managed to identify the problem areas and suggest fixes.  
Overall, this project strengthened our teamwork, problem-solving, and practical understanding of Agile and AI development.


## Future Improvements
- Fix the backend deployment to make the link accessible to all users.  
- Add user authentication for personalized portfolios.  
- Improve UI design and integrate more AI features like CV and cover letter generation.
